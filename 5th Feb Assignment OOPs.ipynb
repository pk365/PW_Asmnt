    "Ans. In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects of a particular type. It defines the properties and methods that an object of that class will have. An object is an instance of a class, which means it is a specific realization of that class. An object has its own state (properties) and behavior (methods), which are defined by the class it belongs to.\n",

    "Ans. The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation refers to the practice of hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world and providing a public interface to access and manipulate the object. In other words, encapsulation ensures that an object's internal state cannot be directly accessed or modified by external code, and instead, it provides a set of public methods or properties that can be used to interact with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction refers to the process of creating a simplified representation of a complex system. In OOP, abstraction involves focusing on the essential features of an object or a system while ignoring the non-essential details. Abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes, interfaces, and inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods. The existing class is called the base or parent class, and the new class is called the derived or child class. Inheritance enables code reuse and allows for the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where the derived classes add new functionality or modify the behavior of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on many forms or to have multiple behaviors. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are objects of the same class, provided they share a common interface or a parent class. Polymorphism is achieved through the use of overriding, overloading, and interface implementation."
